MUST USE PYTHON 3.8!!! rasa is broken with newer python versions, so just make sure to install python 3.8 and rasa will automatically use it 
the start script (start.py) installs the requirements, trains the bot and/or launches the bot. Donnabot can only be started using this command: "python start.py" and not "python3" or "python3.11+"
its possible to start without a virtual enviroment but created a virtual enviroment for python3.8 is highly recommended if you encounter any issues!

if you run into issues saying "rasa not found" try: 
pip uninstall rasa
pip install rasa[full]

you will need to manually install the following requirments:
getch
requests
cython
