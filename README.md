# DonnaBotMain

this bot is my personal assistant, i try to document along the way but theres a lot more to donna then ill ever put here. shes like chat gpt but way more helpful since she can execute custom commands and actions, and help out with things she sees on the screen etc.etc. 

if you download be sure to create a api_key.txt in the main folder with your openai API key, just paste it into the file and save.
